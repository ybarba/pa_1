## Objects

``` r
dur_hablo_stressed <- 0.57
dur_hablo_unstressed <- 0.49
dur_o_stressed <- 0.21
dur_o_unstressed <- 0.15
int_o_stressed <- 66.56
int_o_unstressed <- 73.74
f0_o_stressed <- 217.07
f0_o_unstressed <- 211.87
```

## Operations

``` r
dur_hablo_stressed - dur_hablo_unstressed
```

    ## [1] 0.08

``` r
dur_o_stressed - dur_o_unstressed
```

    ## [1] 0.06

``` r
int_o_stressed - int_o_unstressed
```

    ## [1] -7.18

``` r
f0_o_stressed - f0_o_unstressed
```

    ## [1] 5.2

## Observations

The difference in intensity between the stressed and unstressed \[o\]
didnâ€™t show as expected. On the other hand, the difference in ms between
the stressed and unstressed \[o\] matched the expectations.
